We are going to do a lot of tasks today! Let's write them out.

Implement a method createDailyPlan() that takes an array of string plans and returns a string displaying our daily plans as a list.

Rules:

the list should start with the words "My plans:";
each item is preceded by a new line ("\n") and its order number in the format like "1.) ";
each item is followed by a semicolon.
For example:
plans = ["wake up", "have breakfast", "go to work", "solve 5 tasks from codewars"]

createDailyPlan(plans) ==>
"My plans:
1.) wake up;
2.) have breakfast;
3.) go to work;
4.) solve 5 tasks from codewars;"
